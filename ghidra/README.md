# UnderstandableBinary ghidra distribution and scripts

Setup requirements:

- Linux: nothing
- macOS: nothing, but you must allow some unsigned code and rerun due to SIP (see [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) section "If you want to open an app that hasnâ€™t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer")
- Windows: Doesn't work

How to use:
- Run the shell script `disassemble.sh [args]` (see `disassemble.sh -h` for help)

More info:

- The Java files are Ghidra scripts, `latest_release` is a Ghidra release.
- The shell script runs Ghidra in headless mode (no GUI), but you can also open Ghidra and run the scripts from there
- `BatchDecompile.java` takes a directory of `.o` files and analyzes / decompiles them all, writing `.o.c` files.
- Ghidra has a lot of options. The script just does auto-import and auto-analyze with default options

How to develop:

- Open in IntelliJ
- If you are getting unresolved import errors, download and install [intellij-ghidra](https://github.com/garyttierney/intellij-ghidra) and add Ghidra facets as specified in the plugin's README (note: version on IntelliJ marketplace does not work, you must install the Git release)
